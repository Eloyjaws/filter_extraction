The images have been taken on a Matte finish paper. The reference card used here is RCV1.2.4


21 images: 

Each of the 7 filters were photographed three times, where their placement in the center circle was varied. 

The three locations in the circle at the center are - center (C), left (L) and bottom (B). 
The image filenames end with these letters. 


Note: 
BC concentration for a filter is the same for the three images with changing filter placement.
